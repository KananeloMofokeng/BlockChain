# BlockChain
This project is a basic implementation of a blockchain using Python and Flask. It provides a simple decentralized ledger with functionality for mining new blocks, adding transactions, and retrieving the current chain. The goal is to understand how blockchain works by creating a minimal and self-contained example.
